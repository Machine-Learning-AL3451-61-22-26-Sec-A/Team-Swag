## Description

The Candidate Elimination Algorithm is used for concept learning in machine learning. It iteratively updates the hypothesis space based on the training data until a consistent and minimal hypothesis is achieved.

The script `candidate_elimination.py` contains the implementation of this algorithm. It reads a CSV file containing training data (features and target labels), learns the hypothesis space, and outputs the final specific and general hypotheses.

## File Structure

- `candidate_elimination.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the Candidate Elimination Algorithm.
- `trainingdata.csv`: Sample CSV file containing training data with features and target labels.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialization of specific and general hypotheses.
2. Iteratively update the hypotheses based on the training instances:
   - If the instance is positive, update specific and general hypotheses accordingly.
   - If the instance is negative, update general hypotheses accordingly.
3. Remove inconsistent hypotheses from the general hypothesis space.
4. Return the final specific and general hypotheses.
